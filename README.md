## An Operating System from Scratch, just for learning purposes

This is a project that I've interested into for several years now. What you're seeing here is my 4th attempt at making an Operating System from scratch. The previous were working well but were using a not-so-flex-home-made bootloader. This time, I will use the GRand Unified Bootloader v2 for more flexibility and to allow people to just add it to a grub.cfg and boot it!
